<p>I’ll let you know
All caps, in gold (that I’m gonna go)
I’ll tell the world who I really am</p>

<p>I’m gonna fly
Yeah, I’m gonna soar
I’m gonna be the one who breaks your top score</p>

<p>But somehow…
Yeah, somehow…
I can’t take my eyes off you</p>

<p>But somehow… I can’t take them off</p>

<p>Glasses upside down
You get cold feet, you don’t know how</p>

<p>So you wanna go down, down that road
You’ll be better off alone, just send me home
I ain’t waiting for nobody, no… I’m on my own</p>

<p>I don’t want to pretend
I don’t want to defend myself
In front a court of
blacks and whites
Find the greys, inside
Along the lines
that lead to glory</p>

<p>And I don’t want to pretend
I don’t want to defend myself
In front a court of
blacks and whites
Find the greys, inside
Along the lines
that lead to glory</p>

<p>– Uh-ooh –</p>

<p>So you wanna go down, down that road
You’ll be better off alone, just send me home
I ain’t waiting for nobody, no… I’m on my own</p>

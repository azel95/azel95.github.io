<p>Iâ€™ll let you know<br />
All caps, in gold (that Iâ€™m gonna go)<br />
Iâ€™ll tell the world who I really am</p>

<p>Iâ€™m gonna fly<br />
Yeah, Iâ€™m gonna soar<br />
Iâ€™m gonna be the one who breaks your top score</p>

<p>But somehowâ€¦<br />
Yeah, somehowâ€¦<br />
I canâ€™t take my eyes off you<br />
But somehowâ€¦<br />
I canâ€™t take them off</p>

<p>Glasses upside down<br />
You get cold feet, you donâ€™t know how\</p>

<p>So you wanna go down, down that road<br />
Youâ€™ll be better off alone, just send me home<br />
I ainâ€™t waiting for nobody, noâ€¦ Iâ€™m on my own\</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to pretend<br />
I donâ€™t want to defend myself<br />
In front a court of<br />
blacks and whites<br />
Find the greys, inside<br />
Along the lines<br />
that lead to glory</p>

<p>And I donâ€™t want to pretend<br />
I donâ€™t want to defend myself<br />
In front a court of<br />
blacks and whites<br />
Find the greys, inside<br />
Along the lines<br />
that lead to glory</p>

<p>â€“ Uh-ooh â€“</p>

<p>So you wanna go down, down that road<br />
Youâ€™ll be better off alone, just send me home<br />
I ainâ€™t waiting for nobody, noâ€¦ Iâ€™m on my own</p>

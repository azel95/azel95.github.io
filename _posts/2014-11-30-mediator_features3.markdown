**Segona cançó :** Great Divide

> Tags:

I was lost and found\
At the Great Divide\
Shimmering flats\
And tops alike

I pull up the car\
Interstate's too far\
And I wonder why\
I wonder how you've been

'Cause all things go...\
Yeah everything grows

If I draw the line,\
should I draw my sword?\
When I come back,\
will I know myself? (will I know you?)

'Cause all things go...\
Yeah everything grows

Oh-oh-oooh ooooh... Great Divide!\
Oh-oh-oooh ooooh... Great Divide!\
Oh-oh-oooh ooooh... Great Divide!

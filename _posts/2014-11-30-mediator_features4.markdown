**Primera cançó :** On my own

> Tags:

I'll let you know\
All caps, in gold (that I'm gonna go)\
I'll tell the world who I really am

I'm gonna fly\
Yeah, I'm gonna soar\
I'm gonna be the one who breaks your top score

But somehow...\
Yeah, somehow...\
I can't take my eyes off you\
But somehow...\
I can't take them off

Glasses upside down\
You get cold feet, you don't know how\

So you wanna go down, down that road\
You'll be better off alone, just send me home\
I ain't waiting for nobody, no... I'm on my own\

I don't want to pretend\
I don't want to defend myself\
In front a court of\
blacks and whites\
Find the greys, inside\
Along the lines\
that lead to glory

And I don't want to pretend\
I don't want to defend myself\
In front a court of\
blacks and whites\
Find the greys, inside\
Along the lines\
that lead to glory

-- Uh-ooh --

So you wanna go down, down that road\
You'll be better off alone, just send me home\
I ain't waiting for nobody, no... I'm on my own
